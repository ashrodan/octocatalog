# Welcome to the `octocatalog`

This is a data-platform-in-a-box[^1] based on DuckDB + dbt + Evidence. It offers a simple script to extract and load (EL) data from the [GitHub Archive](https://www.gharchive.org/), a dbt project built on top of this data inside a DuckDB database, and BI tooling via Evidence to analyze and present the data.

It runs completely local or inside of a devcontainer. I call it the Quack Stack.
